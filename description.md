A strategy board game where the goal is to connect all three sides using pieces of your color before your opponent does.

This game was ported to Sandstorm as a demonstration of the [meteor-spk](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/meteor-spk) tool for trivially porting Meteor apps to Sandstorm. Kenton ported the app in three minutes [during a live talk](https://blog.sandstorm.io/news/2014-08-12-meteor-spk.html).
